# Social us

Social us is a simple and efficient social media platform that provides users with a satisfying user experience. By implementing the necessary features such as user profiles, posts, likes, and analytics, the platform will offer users a powerful tool for socializing and sharing their thoughts and ideas.

The backend API will be responsible for handling data storage and retrieval, user authentication, and business logic. It will provide endpoints for creating, reading, updating, and deleting user profiles and posts. It will also handle the logic for handling likes and unlikes.
